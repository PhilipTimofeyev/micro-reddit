# Micro-Reddit

This is a Ruby on Rails project for The Odin Projects curriculum. It is a Rails app designed to explore the core back-end concepts of a site like Reddit, where there are users who can post content and comment on each other's content. 

This project practices:

- Setting up multiple models in Rails.
- Creating validations for the models.
- Creating associations between the models.
- Testing the models, validations, and associations using the Rails console.
